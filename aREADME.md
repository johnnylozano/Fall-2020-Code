Lab5
- medicalAdvise.cpp   - program reads user inputs (Y/N) in order to determine proper medical advise
- meetingDay.cpp      - reads user inputs (days, days until meeting) to find which day of the week is the meeting day
- quadrantFinder.cpp  - reads user inputs (x, y) and determines where the coordinates lie

Lab6
- giveCookie.cpp      - program demands a cookie and loops until user inputs "cookie"
- minMaxUpdater.cpp   - user inputs numbers and program continuous updates min/max values
