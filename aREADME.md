Lab5
- medicalAdvise.cpp   - program reads user inputs (Y/N) in order to determine proper medical advise
- meetingDay.cpp      - reads user inputs (days, days until meeting) to find which day of the week is the meeting day
- quadrantFinder.cpp  - reads user inputs (x, y) and determines where the coordinates lie

Lab6
- giveCookie.cpp      - program demands a cookie and loops until user inputs "cookie"
- minMaxUpdater.cpp   - user inputs numbers and program continuous updates min/max values
- sumOdd.cpp          - user inputs start and end, and program calculates summation of odd numbers

Lab7
- arraySquared.cpp     - User inputs size of array, program fills array with squared integer values
- honorVerify.cpp      - User inputs number of GPAs, and GPA for each number. Program verifies graduation status (grad., not-grad., Cum Laude, etc.)
- arrayComparator.cpp  - User inputs size of array, program creates two arrays with input size. User inputs value of each array, and program compares

Lab9 
- minMaxAvgMethod.cpp    - User inputs 3 numbers, program uses methods to calculate max, min, and average based on user input
